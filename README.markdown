# Dotfiles #####################################################################

Are you surprised?

These are my dotfiles. Based on the decent framework laid down by [Mr.
Holman][0] and others. An interesting note is that I've been doing [this sort
of organization][1] since before it was popular except I was stuck in windows
so I had to jump through rings of fire every now and then to keep my day to day
work uneventful.

I previously kept my dotfiles in a private repository but what you will find
here is a rewrite using all the tricks I have learned over the years. I'm
not going to explain how to install these, I'm sure you can figure that out if
you really wanted to. However, the true value lives in the content of the
files. I think there are some pretty nice things in there tmux, vim and such.
I'm a ZSH lover these days, but still have to play with bash so there is some
decent stuff there as well. Hope you have fun.

### Warning ####################################################################

I often rebase and force push to this repository. I also don't use commit
messages here.
